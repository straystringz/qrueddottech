1. Project name and tagline:
Project Name: "Qrued Resources"
Tagline: "Educate, Innovate, Elevate"

2. Team Members:
- ChocoMarissa: Developer and Project Manager - I will be responsible for overall project development, implementation, and management.

3. Technologies:
- Python: Backend development and server-side scripting.
- Flask: Lightweight web framework for building the website.
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript: Frontend development for the user interface.
- SQLAlchemy: Python SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for database interactions.
- SQLite: Lightweight and serverless relational database management system.
- Git: Version control system for code management.

An alternative option for the backend could have been Django, a more comprehensive web framework. The trade-offs between Flask and Django include:
- Flask: Provides a minimalistic and flexible approach, allowing me to choose the libraries and components needed for the project. It is well-suited for smaller projects and gives me more control over the development process.
- Django: Offers a batteries-included approach with many built-in features, including an ORM, authentication, and admin interface. It is suitable for larger projects with complex requirements and follows conventions that can speed up development.

I decided to use Flask with SQLAlchemy considering my familiarity with them, their simplicity, and the ability to customize the project to my specific needs. SQLite is a lightweight and easy-to-use database management system suitable for smaller projects.

4. Challenge statement:
The "Qrued Resources" website aims to provide a platform for individuals to create and share tech-related lectures while allowing users to log in and access these lectures for free. The project intends to solve the problem of limited access to quality tech education by providing a centralized platform for knowledge sharing and learning.

The Portfolio Project will not solve the challenge of ensuring the quality and credibility of the lectures shared on the platform. It relies on the assumption that the creators will provide accurate and reliable information.

The project will help individuals who are interested in learning about various tech topics. Users can access a wide range of lectures and enhance their knowledge and skills in the tech field.

This project is relevant globally, as it aims to provide free tech education to anyone with an internet connection, regardless of their location.

5. Risks:
Technical risks:
- Scalability: As the user base grows and more lectures are added, the website's performance and scalability might become a concern. To mitigate this, I can employ techniques like caching, optimizing database queries, and utilizing a load balancer if necessary.
- Security: Protecting user data and preventing unauthorized access or data breaches is crucial. I will implement strong authentication mechanisms, secure coding practices, and regularly conduct security audits to mitigate these risks.

Non-technical risks:
- Content quality: Ensuring the accuracy and relevance of lectures uploaded by creators is a potential risk. I will implement a review and rating system, as well as monitor user feedback, to help maintain content quality.
- User engagement: Encouraging users to actively participate, contribute lectures, and provide feedback is essential. I will implement features such as discussion forums, user profiles, and notifications to increase user engagement.

6. Infrastructure:
- Branching and merging: I will follow the Git branching model, such as the Gitflow workflow, to manage code changes effectively and collaborate seamlessly.
- Deployment strategy: The Flask application can be deployed on a cloud hosting platform like Heroku, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, or a virtual private server. I will automate the deployment process using tools like Flask CLI or Docker.
- Data population: Initially, the app can be populated with sample data or manually added content. As the platform gains traction, I will allow users to create

 and share their lectures, thereby populating the app with user-generated content.
- Testing: Flask provides testing utilities that allow me to write unit tests and integration tests for the application. I will use tools like pytest or Flask-Testing to automate the testing process.

7. Existing Solutions:
- Udemy: A popular online learning platform where instructors can create and sell courses. Unlike Qrued Resources, Udemy courses are typically paid.
- Coursera: Another well-known platform offering online courses from universities and organizations. Coursera also offers both free and paid courses but follows a structured learning format.
- Khan Academy: A free online learning platform with a wide range of educational resources, including tech-related topics. However, it may not provide the same level of interactivity and community features as Qrued Resources.

The Qrued Resources project aims to differentiate itself by focusing on free, community-driven tech education, allowing individuals to create and share their tech lectures and fostering a collaborative learning environment.

I'm using Flask as the web framework, SQLAlchemy as the ORM for database interactions, and SQLite as the database management system. Flask-Login is an extension for handling user authentication and sessions in Flask applications.
